# WZ diboson production in a three-lepton final state
Exploration of Machine Learning methods to improve classical searches in Particle Physics.

# Dataset
[ATLAS Open Data](https://opendata.atlas.cern/)  
3lep dataset from the [13 TeV Data for Education](https://opendata.atlas.cern/docs/documentation/overview_data/data_education_2020)

# Goal
Replace existing cuts in analysis by a Machine Learning model, in order to try to optimize the ratio of signals to backgrounds and the final number of signals.
